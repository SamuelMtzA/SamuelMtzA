### Hey!👋

## :book: 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎
I'm a web developer from Mexico, who are learning about open source, and is currently working at Infosys. I mainly code in Javascript, in 2021 I change my path from electronics engineer to software engineer and fell in love with Javascript, React, Nodejs and so many other modern web frameworks. I am always learning. Currently I'm also working on Java with Springboot, including cloud computing (Azure and AWS). I also am trying to contributing in Open Source projects.
