### Hey!👋

## :book: 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎
I'm a software engineer from Mexico, who is learning about open source and is currently working as an SDET with Java and Selenium. I mainly code in Javascript, and in 2021 I changed my path from electronics engineering to software engineering and fell in love with Javascript, React, Node.js, and so many other modern web frameworks. I am always learning. I'm also working on Java with Springboot, including cloud computing (Azure and AWS). I am also trying to contribute to open source projects and create content in Spanish about programming on TikTok as <a
